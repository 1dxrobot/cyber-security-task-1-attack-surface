Introduction to the CIA Triad
The CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—is a foundational model in cybersecurity used to guide policies and strategies for protecting information. Despite its name, it has no connection to the Central Intelligence Agency; instead, it represents three core principles that ensure data remains secure, accurate, and accessible.
<h4> 1.Confidentiality in Cybersecurity </h4>
<li>Encryption</li> <li> Access Control </li>   <li>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) </li>
<h4> 2.Integrity in Cybersecurity </h4>
<li>Hashing</li> <li>Digital signatures</li>
<li>Version control systems</li>
<h4> 3.Availability in Cybersecurity</h4>
<li>Redundant systems </li>
<li>Disaster recovery plans </li>
<li>DDoS protection </li>

<h3> CIA Triad in Social Media </h3>
Confidentiality:<li>User passwords and private messages are encrypted. Platforms use OAuth and MFA to prevent account takeovers. </li> 
Integrity: <li>Measures like content hashing and audit logs help detect fake accounts or manipulated posts. However, misinformation remains a challenge.</li> 
Availability:<li>Platforms must remain online despite massive traffic. Content delivery networks (CDNs) and auto-scaling cloud infrastructure ensure continuous access.</li>
<br>
<h2> Script Kiddies</h2>
<li>Attacker Who Use pre written Tools Or Script developed By Others without Understanding an Underlying the mechanism. </li>
<br>
<h2> Insiders</h2>
<li>Insider threats come from individuals within an organization—employees, contractors, or partners—who misuse their authorized access to compromise data or systems. </li>
<br> 
<h2> Hacktivists</h2>
<li> Hacktivists use cyber attacks to promote political, social, or ideological causes. They often target organizations they perceive as unethical.</li> 
<br> 
<h2> Nation-State Actors</h2>
<li> Nation-state actors are highly skilled, well-funded groups backed by governments to conduct cyber espionage, sabotage critical infrastructure, or steal intellectual property.</li>
